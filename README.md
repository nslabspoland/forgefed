ForgeFed is **mock** of ActivityPub-based federation protocol for software forges.

## Contributing

There's a huge variety of tasks to do! Come open an issue.

However, to maintain user-friendly working environment, we do reserve the issue
tracker for *practical, actionable work items*.

If you wish to join the work on the ForgeFed specification, here are some
technical but important details:

- We don't push commits to the main branch, we always open a pull request
- Pull requests making changes to the specification content must have at least
  2 reviews and then they wait for a cooldown period of 2 weeks during which
  more people can provide feedback, raise challenges and conflicts, improve the
  proposed changes etc.
- If you wish to continuously participate in shaping the specification, it
  would be useful to go over the open PRs once a week or so, to make sure you
  have a chance to communicate your needs, ideas and thoughts before changes
  get merged into the spec

Important files in this repo to know about:

- The file `resources.md` lists which team members have access to which project
  resources, openness and transparency are important to us!
